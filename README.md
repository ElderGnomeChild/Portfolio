# Daniel Lier - Portfolio
Portfolio to showcase my skills and previous projects. Planning on moving this to its own website soon.

<h1>Projects</h1>
<h2>Babysitter Portal</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/ElderGnomeChild/ParkCitySitters" target="_blank">Repository</a><br>
	In my Web Apps class, my group of three developers and two designers worked with a local small business to develop a web app that would suit their needs. The idea was to create a system that would allow the owner to post jobs on the website so that babysitters could claim them without further action from the owner.

<br><h2>Waste Project</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/ElderGnomeChild/wasteproject" target="_blank">Repository</a><br>
	The final project for my Database Systems class was to build a program that used a database. My group worked with the environmental center at Westminster College to create a system that could track and classify the waste picked up from campus. The experience was one that encompassed three of the computer science program's four learning goals. It helped me understand software design, acquire significant project experience, and develop effective problem-solving skills. We, as a group, had to design a piece of software that solved a problem facing the environmental department at our school. 
	<br><br>I chose this assignment for my portfolio because it heavily involves interacting with a database. Back-end development is something of a strong suit of mine and this is the first project where I honed those skills. In addition, it was the first group programming project I had as well as the first time a group of mine had to produce a deliverable, usable piece of software. Java was the primary language that we programmed in for this project. We used Java Swing for our user interface and SQLite for our database.

<br><h2>Math Game Project</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/ElderGnomeChild/SoftwareEngineering" target="_blank">Repository</a><br>
	In my Software Engineering class, the entire semester was devoted to planning and creating a math game for first and second graders. We used Agile project management and developed in three sprints with releases and presentations after each sprint. This project leaned heavily into the CS department's software design learning goal. We had frequent meetings and periodic planning periods where we talked about the best way to design and improve our software. 
	<br><br>This assignment is relevant for my portfolio because it entails the evolution of my back-end experience through use of Django as well as some basic website creation and game design. I used Django to create a login system with two different user types: teachers and students. Teachers can see students' progress as well as add students to their class. Students can play the math game and see their previous progress. I used Unity  and C# to create the game that the students would play. The 3d and movement graphics were pulled from the Unity asset store and the 2d sprites were drawn by one of my group members. This project was my first experience with Django and Unity as well as my first experience with web hosting.
